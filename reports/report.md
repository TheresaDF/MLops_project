### Question 3
> **What framework did you choose to work with and did it help you complete the project?**
>
> Answer length: 100-200 words.
>
> Example:
> *We used the third-party framework ... in our project. We used functionality ... and functionality ... from the*
> *package to do ... and ... in our project*.
>
> Answer:

--- For the main model, a VAE, we wrote a simple CNN ourselves using PyTorch. To compute the loss however, we empployed the third party Structural Similarity Index (SSIM)
loss function from Kornia, since this loss measures similarity between two given images. We would like to increase similarity as much as possible 
between our input and output, why this loss seemed fitting. In order to reduce boilerplate code, pytorch_lightning is used for training the model. The use of this
framework enables several beneficial functionalities, such as early stopping and distributed training. The use of the library Hydra ensured easy management of 
hyperparameters during training, and enables sweeping for optimal parameters. ---

## Coding environment

> In the following section we are interested in learning more about you local development environment.

### Question 4

> **Explain how you managed dependencies in your project? Explain the process a new team member would have to go**
> **through to get an exact copy of your environment.**
>
> Answer length: 100-200 words
>
> Example:
> *We used ... for managing our dependencies. The list of dependencies was auto-generated using ... . To get a*
> *complete copy of our development environment, one would have to run the following commands*
>
> Answer:

--- The management of dependencies was handled somewhat manually. Every time a new package was used it needed to go in a requirements file. 
To ensure the list contains all the necessary packages continuous integration is applied to our GitHub repo. In order for this to be more foolproof
it naturally requires a good amount of test with a good coverage.    ---

### Question 5

> **We expect that you initialized your project using the cookiecutter template. Explain the overall structure of your**
> **code. Did you fill out every folder or only a subset?**
>
> Answer length: 100-200 words
>
> Example:
> *From the cookiecutter template we have filled out the ... , ... and ... folder. We have removed the ... folder*
> *because we did not use any ... in our project. We have added an ... folder that contains ... for running our*
> *experiments.*
> Answer:

--- The project was initialized using the cookiecutter template provided in the M6-module of the course. The overall structure can be seen 
[here](https://github.com/TheresaDF/MLops_project/tree/main). More folders have been added with the use of dvc for data version control, 
the configuration files for hydra and a folder named "instructions" gathering all commands required to solve a specific task. For example one file
is called "build_docker" that details the command needed to build an image and run it afterwards. The visualize folder was not really used; our
project aimed to used a VAE to create more images of cats which means the predict function worked more as an inference script generating images of cats
by parsing noise through the decoder. There was not the same need for a dedicated prediction script, sa we tracked inputs and their corresponding reconstructions 
using wandb.   ---

### Question 6

> **Did you implement any rules for code quality and format? Additionally, explain with your own words why these**
> **concepts matters in larger projects.**
>
> Answer length: 50-100 words.
>
> Answer:

--- Yes. We aimed to follow the `pep8` conventions i.e. classes are with captial starting letters, while function with small letters where words are separated using underscores. This made it easier to quickly recocnize a function from a class. Furthermore, we have included typing and doc strings to our functions, however, some function descriptions are more thorough. The reason. In Python it is not nessessary to declare the type of variables, therefore it is a good practise to enter the types in the function heads to easier understand the input and output of functions. ---

## Version control

> In the following section we are interested in how version control was used in your project during development to
> corporate and increase the quality of your code.

### Question 7

> **How many tests did you implement and what are they testing in your code?**
>
> Answer length: 50-100 words.
>
> Example:
> *In total we have implemented X tests. Primarily we are testing ... and ... as these the most critical parts of our*
> *application but also ... .*
>
> Answer:

--- In total we have implemented two test files (data and model) each consisting of 3 and 5 assert statements respectively. The data testing included primarily testing of the image shapes and pixel values while the model testing mostly consists of checking the model forward shapes and generation shape. ---

### Question 8

> **What is the total code coverage (in percentage) of your code? If you code had an code coverage of 100% (or close**
> **to), would you still trust it to be error free? Explain you reasoning.**
>
> Answer length: 100-200 words.
>
> Example:
> *The total code coverage of code is X%, which includes all our source code. We are far from 100% coverage of our **
> *code and even if we were then...*
>
> Answer:

--- Our total code coverage is at $81\%$, tests have been made for the data and model. No, even with $100\%$ coverage these type of tests cannot account for mathematical or model performance errors. ---

### Question 9

> **Did you workflow include using branches and pull requests? If yes, explain how. If not, explain how branches and**
> **pull request can help improve version control.**
>
> Answer length: 100-200 words.
>
> Example:
> *We made use of both branches and PRs in our project. In our group, each member had an branch that they worked on in*
> *addition to the main branch. To merge code we ...*
>
> Answer:

--- Despite the advantages of branches and pull requests, we did not use it in our workflow as this is a small project and our group is rather small as well. The pros of using pull requests is that the main branch is more "protected" so pushing to the main branch has to be checked by one or more people, while branches allow for experimentation without the fear of ruining the already deployed and working model. ---

### Question 10

> **Did you use DVC for managing data in your project? If yes, then how did it improve your project to have version**
> **control of your data. If no, explain a case where it would be beneficial to have version control of your data.**
>
> Answer length: 100-200 words.
>
> Example:
> *We did make use of DVC in the following way: ... . In the end it helped us in ... for controlling ... part of our*
> *pipeline*
>
> Answer:

--- We did make use of DVC in the following way; adding the data on Google Drive using DVC and afterwards linked it to a Google Clould Bucket. We never used other verisons of the data, however in the end this helped us to easily share the data with each other. ---

### Question 11

> **Discuss you continues integration setup. What kind of CI are you running (unittesting, linting, etc.)? Do you test**
> **multiple operating systems, python version etc. Do you make use of caching? Feel free to insert a link to one of**
> **your github actions workflow.**
>
> Answer length: 200-300 words.
>
> Example:
> *We have organized our CI into 3 separate files: one for doing ..., one for running ... testing and one for running*
> *... . In particular for our ..., we used ... .An example of a triggered workflow can be seen here: <weblink>*
>
> Answer:

--- We have applied continues integration (CI) by both using unittesting with GitHub Actions and trigger workflow for automatically updating Docker images. We have organized our unittesting into two separate files: one for running data testing and one for model testing. These tests are all in a single folder. Our CI is integrated with GitHub Action, however only on one operating system (ubunto-latest), as we experienced errors with using multiple operating systems as the testing were queued for about 48 hours and then failed to run. In addition we also only tested for a single python version (3.11). An example of a triggered workflow can be seen here: <https://github.com/TheresaDF/MLops_project/actions/runs/7553326045>. For trigger workflow we are building two images; one for training and the other for prediction (inference).  ---

## Running code and tracking experiments

> In the following section we are interested in learning more about the experimental setup for running your code and
> especially the reproducibility of your experiments.

### Question 12

> **How did you configure experiments? Did you make use of config files? Explain with coding examples of how you would**
> **run a experiment.**
>
> Answer length: 50-100 words.
>
> Example:
> *We used a simple argparser, that worked in the following way: python my_script.py --lr 1e-3 --batch_size 25*
>
> Answer:

--- We used Hydra for configuring our experiments. We use both a configuration file for data and another for model and training experiments. To conduct a new experiment, one has to create a new experiment yaml file in the folder conf/experiments with the various hyperparameters set and passing this to the training as such: python vae_cats/train_model.py experiments=<my_new_exp>. Furthermore, during prediction we parsed our trained model to the script using an argparser. 

### Question 13

> **Reproducibility of experiments are important. Related to the last question, how did you secure that no information**
> **is lost when running experiments and that your experiments are reproducible?**
>
> Answer length: 100-200 words.
>
> Example:
> *We made use of config files. Whenever an experiment is run the following happens: ... . To reproduce an experiment*
> *one would have to do ...*
>
> Answer:

--- By having the experiment configuration files, we know which hyperparameters have been used for training. Furthermore, the configuration file includes a seed, hence the results are reproducible. ---

### Question 14

> **Upload 1 to 3 screenshots that show the experiments that you have done in W&B (or another experiment tracking**
> **service of your choice). This may include loss graphs, logged images, hyperparameter sweeps etc. You can take**

### Question 15

> **Docker is an important tool for creating containerized applications. Explain how you used docker in your**
> **experiments? Include how you would run your docker images and include a link to one of your docker files.**
>
> Answer length: 100-200 words.
>
> Example:
> *For our project we developed several images: one for training, inference and deployment. For example to run the*
> *training docker image: `docker run trainer:latest lr=1e-3 batch_size=64`. Link to docker file: <weblink>*
>
> Answer:

--- For our project we developed several images: one for training and one for testing. When running our docker training images a few arguments are needed; As we use Weights & Biases (wandb) an API key for a wandb account is needed, and the trained model has to be mounted locally as well. For example to run the training docker image: `docker run -e WANDB_API_KEY=<key> -v "$(pwd)"/models:/models --name trainer_run1 trainer:latest experiments=exp1`. Link to docker file: <weblink>*. For running the prediction image the newly trained model has to be mounted onto the image: `docker run --name run_pred1 --rm -v "$(pwd)"/models/my_model.pt:/models/my_model.pt predict:latest --model models/my_model.pt` ---
